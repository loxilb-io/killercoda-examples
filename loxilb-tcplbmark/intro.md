#  Achieving LoxiLB IPv4 TCP Load Balancing Test with Marking

Welcome to the tutorial where you learn how to configure LoxiLB.

On a serious note, we will look into how to use LoxiLB Marking feature to apply LB policy selectively. 

`Marking` is meaning that LB can match some internal marking field to apply LB policy selectively. Normally LoxiLB can support ACL feature and push mark field action. You can check LoxiLB internal table architecture and order on https://github.com/loxilb-io/loxilbdocs/blob/main/docs/loxilbebpf.md

LoxiLB was built with this in mind and it in this tutorial you will learn:

* How to configure **LoxiLB**: How to setup it and How to use loxi CLI.
* How to do a troubleshoot.
* How to test performance.
