#  Achieving LoxiLB IPv4 Basic TCP Load Balancing Test with One-ARM Mode

Welcome to the tutorial where you learn how to configure LoxiLB.

On a serious note, we will look into how to use LoxiLB for IPv4 LB test with One-ARM Mode. 

In One-ARM deployment, the load balancer is not physically in line of the traffic, which means that the load balancerâ€™s ingress and egress traffic goes through the same network interface. Traffic from the client through the load balancer is network address translated (NAT) with the load balancer as its source address. The nodes send their return traffic to the load balancer before being passed back to the client. Without this reverse packet flow, return traffic would try to reach the client directly, causing connections to fail.

LoxiLB was built with this in mind and it in this tutorial you will learn:

* How to configure **LoxiLB**
* How to do a troubleshoot.
* How to test performance.
