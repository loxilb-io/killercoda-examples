Expose Apache on port 1234 using Docker:

```
docker run -p 1234:80 httpd:alpine
```{{exec}}

Now access Apache using this link:

[ACCESS APACHE]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_1234}})

It's also possible to access ports using the top-right navigation in the terminal.
Or we can display the link to that page:

[ACCESS PORTS]({{TRAFFIC_SELECTOR}})
